### Developing 

This repo was built using a (now ancient) version of node & npm. 
The following conda environment works as of October 2023:
```
conda create --name phandango -c conda-forge nodejs=8
```
Hot reloading no longer works, and if you use VS-Code you need to prefix commands with `NODE_OPTIONS=""`
